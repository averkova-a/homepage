# Greetings!
There is the [Resume](https://averkova-a.github.io/homepage/) for talanated fighter Ryu Hoshi (リュウ Ryū).

It was created using [Wiki](https://github.com/volodymyr-kushnir/volodymyrkushnir.com/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) and also there are my own features like Modals and dancing marshmellows (sounds intriguing, right?). There is no JavaScrip code *yet* so all elements and Modals was created using only HTML and CSS.
